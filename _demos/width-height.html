title: Animating width and height instead of scale
index: 4
description: |
    In some cases you might want to animate `width`/`height` instead of 
    `transform: scale`. This can be done by setting `useScale` to false.

    This is currently only available through the `FLIPElement` class.
    [Work is being done on exposing it through the `flip(...)` function.](https://github.com/birjolaxew/flippy.js/issues/9)

    **Warning:** This is less performant than animating `transform: scale`, and should be used with care.
